# July 18 - Schematic and Design (1.5 hours)

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

Today I drew the schematic and chosen the parts for the PCB, I followed the [OnBoard tutorial](https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/hacker-card) for this

Most of the SMD componants are using the 1206 footprint since I am hand soldering them. I also added a few componants on the schematic so that the footprint will be shown on the PCB (I won't be soldering them, it's just a reference)

The back of the PCB is going to be like a useful PCB design tool.

# July 19 - PCB Layout (1 hour)

Today I made the PCB layout, the size of the board is 85.5mm x 53.8mm (same size as a credit card).

I put my info like my website and my GitHub profile on the front silkscreen layer and some various PCB design tools in the back

# July 20 - Final Design (1.5 hours)

Today I decided to make the PCB look better, since I have more experience with KiCad, I exported the EasyEDA project and imported it to KiCad.

I started by drawing copper pours around the NFC antenna on both sides (so the card can be tapped on either side)

<img width="321" height="592" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/438ac292-312a-44f0-a769-5dd71b6c2ab2" />

And then I drew copper pour for the rest of the PCB. I decided to use hatched patterns for the top side since I think it would look quite good.

And I kept the bottom as solid pour.

I also replaced the keychain hole with one with pads on both sides

And then I added the Highway artwork to the bottom side
