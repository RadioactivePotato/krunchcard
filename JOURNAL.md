Today I drew the schematic and chosen the parts for the PCB, I followed the [OnBoard tutorial](https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/hacker-card) for this

Most of the SMD componants are using the 1206 footprint since I am hand soldering them. I also added a few componants on the schematic so that the footprint will be shown on the PCB (I won't be soldering them, it's just a reference)

The back of the PCB is going to be like a useful PCB design tool.

Today I made the PCB layout, the size of the board is 85.5mm x 53.8mm (same size as a credit card).

I put my info like my website and my GitHub profile on the front silkscreen layer and some various PCB design tools in the back
